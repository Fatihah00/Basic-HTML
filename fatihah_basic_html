<center> <h1> Disadvantages of Online Distance Learning </h1> </center>

<p style="color:Blue;"> <i> 1. Difficulty Staying Motivated: for many people, not having a classroom and set classroom 
times can make it difficult to remember to check in, or even to want to check in. It's important for you to have all the motivation 
necessary within yourself to look at the website, complete the assignments and get them in on time, even though everything is still 
required to be completed on a timely basis, just like with a more traditional classroom atmosphere. For those who don't have the 
self-motivation these classes can result in spending a lot of money on retaking classes because you’ve forgotten an assignment. </i> </p>


<p style="color:Blue;"> <i> 2. Difficulty Staying in Contact with Instructors: If you ever have trouble with assignments, 
or questions about a lecture while in a traditional class it's generally quite simple to talk to your instructor before or 
after class or schedule meetings online at a different time. When you're distance learning, however, you're going to have 
more difficulty getting in touch with your instructor. Though you can send an email, it's definitely not going to get you the 
immediate response you'd get if you were able to sit down with your instructor. </i> </p>


<p style="color:Blue;"> <i> 3. Difficulty Staying Connected at All Times: For those who don't have a reliable source of electricity 
or don't have reliable internet, it can be difficult to always get to a friend's house, a café, a library or somewhere else where 
internet access is readily available. And this kind of access is crucial for distance learning. Some programs may even require you 
to have a DVD or CD player for certain materials or other types of equipment that you have to purchase, find or rent for yourself 
(not to mention figure out how to use properly). All of this on top of the fact that your computer could quit at any moment, and 
for no reason or your power could go out for a few days and suddenly you're behind with no way to fix it. </i> </p>
